# CinemaProject

The aim of this project was to develop a Cinema Website for those who wish to escape the reality for several hours. 
Visitors have the possibility to register / login and make reservations for the movie they wish to watch & select the seats they like.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. 

Please note that the project is divided in 2 elements: Front-End and Back-End, both located in my GitHub repository.

## Prerequisites
Required software: For Back-End: An IDE chosen by the user (Intellij IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans etc.)
                    For Front-End: Any IDEs that can run HTML files (Intellij IDEA Ultimate versions, WebStorm or even Tomcat)


## Installing & Running the tests
In order to start the application, you need to open an IDE and run the CinemaApplication.java class. Then with one of the above mentioned
software for Front-End you run the "index.html" file and enjoy surfing on the site.
